##How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Honestly, I’ve learned that the best way to make sure my code works is by testing—a lot. I wrote unit tests for every piece of code, which helped catch mistakes early before they turned into bigger problems. Using JUnit, I was able to check if my methods did what they were supposed to do (and not break anything else in the process). For security, I learned to be careful with things like input validation so people can’t mess up the program by entering something weird. Keeping my code simple and clear also makes it easier to spot anything that might be off.

##How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Figuring out what users want isn’t always easy, but writing out user stories really helped me stay on track. When I see something like “As a user, I want to add a new contact so I can keep track of my friends,” it makes it way clearer what the program should do. Instead of guessing, I break down what the user actually needs and build features that make sense. Plus, user stories keep me from building random stuff that nobody will ever use.

##How do I approach designing software?
For me, designing software is all about breaking things down into smaller chunks so I don’t get overwhelmed. I start by thinking about the main features, then I sketch out what each class or method should do. Once I have a plan, I build a piece at a time and write tests for each one. I try to keep things flexible, because there’s always going to be something that needs to change later. Basically, I just try to stay organized, take it one step at a time, and test as I go.
